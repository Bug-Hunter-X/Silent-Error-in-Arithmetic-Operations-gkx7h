This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating a silent error in arithmetic operations. The `operate` function handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but it does not correctly handle the modulo operator.  The code includes both the buggy version and a corrected version.  The bug manifests as a silent error where instead of correctly evaluating a modulo operation, the code throws an error.  The solution demonstrates how to extend the `switch` statement to correctly handle the modulo operator.
